AI Agents Hackathon 2024
Here is a list of references that we can look into:
suno.com
beatoven.ai
soundful.ai
mynoise.net

We are trying to create a mood music generator, that not only generates music from text, images and videos etc
It also acts a source of therapy, hence we are making therapy clones for assisting users with therapy and different forms of therapy like music therapy, mood therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) 
We can't replicate or duplicate therapists and their actual jobs or behaviors, neither AI or AGI or any SuperAGI can reach that level of accuracy where it can replace humans and therapists totally
But what we can do is - take some preliminary learnings, insights and extract information, train and test accordingly, we can help humans with therapy just like music, dance and arts does! We can help them understand their moods, feelings and emotions - even their behaviours, trauma, tragedy to some levels of accuracy.
Once the user types in, and talks about what the user is feeling, behaving or what the user is going through - the AI takes form of a buddy first, talk to the user more like a friend and a support and suggest some initial suggestions, based on some further conversations and interactions, can suggest more doable list of things
Now if the user wishes, the user can take help of music generation, according to the text, image prompt (for now let us keep this only to text to music)
Once music is generated, user can listen and provide feedback on the same
We also want to integrate the features of music composition, lyrics written and background music provided by AI
The AI should help the user to compose music, change the music mood, change the user mood, change tones and rhthyms, set a particular genre to it with beats and make a 3 min audio track of the same
Later features will involve full fledge audio and video along with background music, video generation capabilities and much more
Currently, we also want to open a safe space for dating, if the user wishes to date or connect with people - much like dating app
But this dating app will be based on music, the music interests, the music composed and the music generated, further more what the user is looking into, will set and act as interests and lists of preferences for finding other users and connecting with them.
So far we haven't seen such apps that allow users to connect based on therapy, music, music therapy, creativity and much more!
